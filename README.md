**Cab Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning**

**Overview**
This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts cab fares based on trip distance, time of day, passenger count, and other factors. By analyzing real-world cab data, the project explores various machine learning techniques to identify the most effective approach for fare prediction.

**Objectives**
1. **Fare Transparency**: Provide accurate and fair fare predictions to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce disputes.
2. **Model Optimization**: Compare and optimize multiple machine learning models to identify the best one for the task.
3. **Insight Generation**: Understand how factors like trip distance, pickup time, and passenger count influence cab fares.

**Key Features**
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: 
  - Filtered invalid or extreme values for fare amounts, passenger counts, and geographic coordinates.
  - Extracted time-related features (e.g., hour, day, month, year) from timestamps.
  - Calculated trip distances using geodesic coordinates.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Added new features like trip distance and temporal information to improve model performance.

- **Model Development and Evaluation**:
  - Implemented and compared multiple regression models, including:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees
